# Introduction to Computer Architecture 

## Types Computer systems and their Fuctionality Difference 

Computer systems are basically of two type :
- Embedded Computers.           
-  Desktop Computers.

They both have various forms of input and output devices, processors and memory units. The primary difference between them is
that the Desktop computer is used to run various applications where as the emedded computer is used to run only a single kind
of application. The embedded computers are mostly dependent on the software they work on and not on the hardware used for the 
computer.

## Concepts

Whatever operation that you perform on a computer is just simple manupulation of numbers and there different implications to 
different applications and nothing more than that. A computer has many components of hardwares and software. The processor is the 
heart of the computers and the hardware executes the program. The system also has a memory unit which stores the program
while it's exetition.
